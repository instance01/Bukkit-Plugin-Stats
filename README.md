Bukkit-Plugin-Stats
===================

This will show current statistics of all your plugins in one place.


See an example [here](http://instancelabs.eu5.org/pluginstatus/).



It will currently show Downloads, Stage, License and the main picture, but I'll add more things like the last two comments etc. soon.



Setup
=====

Adjust the $plugins array to your needs, just paste the following part of your plugin url into an array item:

Dependencies
============

You'll need Curl to have installed on your webserver, also I'm using the bootstrap API here, though it's not really necessary as of now (might become later).
