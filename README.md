Bukkit-Plugin-Stats
===================

This will show current statistics of all your plugins in one place.


See an example [here](http://instancelabs.eu5.org/bukkitstats/).



It will currently show Downloads, Stage, the main picture and the last comment. Will also inform you if a project is not approved yet.



Setup

Dependencies
============

You'll need Curl to have installed on your webserver, also I'm using the bootstrap API here, though it's not really necessary as of now (might become later).
